# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is a widely used open source database management system (DBMS) that is designed for easy development and deployment. In addition to being a relational database management system, it is also a full-text search engine, a query language, and a programming language. In this project, I will be using Python to create an object-relational mapping (ORM) for a database.
